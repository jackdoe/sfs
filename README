very basic mysql backed fuse file system.
0: abstract
	fuse based, mysql backed file system

1. requirements:
	fuse, mysql, pthreads, c compiler

2. install:
	download from https://github.com/jackdoe/sfs
	$EDOTOR common.h #put proper mysql settings into common.h
	make #DEBUG=1 if you want debug output
	./sfs /mnt/fuse

3. info:
	this is the table that is used:
	
	Q("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `entries_%s` (	\
	`id` bigint(20) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,	\
	`path` varchar(255) NOT NULL,			\
	`data` longblob,				\
	`obj_type` int(11) NOT NULL,			\
	`uid` bigint(20) NOT NULL,			\
	`gid` bigint(20) NOT NULL,			\
	`mode` bigint(20) NOT NULL,			\
	`atime` bigint(20) NOT NULL,			\
	`mtime` bigint(20) NOT NULL,			\
	`ctime` bigint(20) NOT NULL,			\
	`btime` bigint(20) NOT NULL,			\
	PRIMARY KEY (`id`),				\
	UNIQUE KEY `path` (`path`))",identifier);
	
	identifier is a copy of the mysql username (for example root)
	and the table will be entries_root
	table is automaticaly created at start, root directory is auto inserted as well
	
	mysql user needs to select/update/delete/insert and maybe create if you dont have
	the table created.

	
4. idea:
	i made this as proof of concept to be used in diskless linux based routers,
	where i can edit their config files remotely - for example /etc or /usr/local/etc,
	with simple web based application.

5. supported calls:
	sfs_oper.getattr	= sfs_getattr;
	sfs_oper.readdir	= sfs_readdir;
	sfs_oper.open		= sfs_open;
	sfs_oper.write		= sfs_write;
	sfs_oper.truncate	= sfs_truncate;
	sfs_oper.read		= sfs_read;
	sfs_oper.create		= sfs_create;
	sfs_oper.unlink		= sfs_delete;
	sfs_oper.chmod		= sfs_chmod;
	sfs_oper.chown		= sfs_chown;
	sfs_oper.statfs		= sfs_statfs;
	sfs_oper.mkdir		= sfs_mkdir;
	sfs_oper.readlink	= sfs_readlink;
	sfs_oper.symlink	= sfs_symlink;
	sfs_oper.rename		= sfs_rename;
	sfs_oper.rmdir		= sfs_rmdir;
	sfs_oper.utimens	= sfs_utimens;

6. limitations:
	MAX_PATH_SIZE: 256 chars
	max data size: mysql's longblob 4gb
	read/write is extreamly slow on big files
	currently there is no locking
