very basic mysql backed fuse file system.

requirements:
	fuse, mysql, pthreads, c compiler

install:
	download from https://github.com/jackdoe/sfs
	$EDOTOR common.h #put proper mysql settings into common.h
	make #DEBUG=1 if you want debug output
	./sfs /mnt/fuse

info:
	by default the tables are named after mysql user
	for exmple: `entries_username`
	table is automaticaly created, root directory is automaticaly inserted
	
idea:
	i made this as proof of concept to be used in diskless linux based routers,
	where i can edit their config files remotely - for example /etc or /usr/local/etc,
	with simple web based application.

supported calls:
	sfs_oper.getattr	= sfs_getattr;
	sfs_oper.readdir	= sfs_readdir;
	sfs_oper.open		= sfs_open;
	sfs_oper.write		= sfs_write;
	sfs_oper.truncate	= sfs_truncate;
	sfs_oper.read		= sfs_read;
	sfs_oper.create		= sfs_create;
	sfs_oper.unlink		= sfs_delete;
	sfs_oper.chmod		= sfs_chmod;
	sfs_oper.chown		= sfs_chown;
	sfs_oper.statfs		= sfs_statfs;
	sfs_oper.mkdir		= sfs_mkdir;
	sfs_oper.readlink	= sfs_readlink;
	sfs_oper.symlink	= sfs_symlink;
	sfs_oper.rename		= sfs_rename;
	sfs_oper.rmdir		= sfs_rmdir;
	sfs_oper.utimens	= sfs_utimens;
