*WARNING: experimental stage, work in progress, DOES NOT USE SSL, DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION*

very basic mysql backed fuse file system.

requirements:
	fuse, mysql, pthreads, c compiler

install:
	download from https://github.com/jackdoe/sfs
	$EDOTOR common.h #put proper mysql settings into common.h
	make #DEBUG=1 if you want debug output
	./sfs /mnt/fuse

info:
	by default the tables are named after mysql user
	for exmple: `entries_username`
	table is automaticaly created, root directory is automaticaly inserted
	
idea:
	i made this as proof of concept to be used in diskless linux based routers,
	where i can edit their config files remotely - for example /etc or /usr/local/etc,
	with simple web based application.
